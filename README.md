This project is built based on [Mountain Ridges](https://glitch.com/~blueridge). The mountain ranges are generated by an implementation of the
[midpoint displacement algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm). The moon azimuth and phase are calculated using [SunCalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc).
