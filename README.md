# â›° Mountains in ðŸŒ„ Day & ðŸŒƒ Night

 ![demo pic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puyihua/mountain-and-sky-based-on-ur-location/master/demo.png)
A little art project that can produce a mountain view which features adaptive sky view based on user's location and time.

## Features based on user's time and location
* Sun
   * Rise & Set 
   * Azimuth
* Moon
   * Rise & Set
   * Azimuth
   * Phase
* Sky
   * Lights up when sunrise
   * Lights down when sunset

## Specs
* web framework
   * [hyperapp](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp)
* drawing
   * SVG


User's rough location is obtained by IP with an [IP-to-location API](https://api.ipdata.co?api-key=test). The mountain ranges are generated by an implementation of the
[midpoint displacement algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm). 
Sunrise and sunset time are calculated by an algorithms taken from [sunrise_sunset_algorithm](http://williams.best.vwh.net/sunrise_sunset_algorithm.htm). 
The moon azimuth and phase are calculated using [SunCalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc).
